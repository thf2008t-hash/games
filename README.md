# Elite Penalty Shootout

This project hosts a self-contained, FIFA-inspired shootout where you alternate between burying kicks and making heroic saves beneath stadium floodlights. The scene is rendered with HTML5 canvas — from the animated run-up to the diving keeper and net ripples.

## How to play

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
2. During your striking turn, use the **Aim** slider to bend the ball and the **Power** slider to set pace. Click **Shoot** to trigger a full run-up animation and unleash your kick.
3. When the roles switch, adjust your **Dive Angle** and **Explosiveness** sliders, then press **Dive** to spring across goal with a fingertip save attempt.
4. The glassy scoreboard highlights your current phase (Striker or Keeper), tallies goals and saves, and the commentary panel narrates every top-corner rocket, clutch stop, and crossbar rattle.

The experience runs entirely in the browser using HTML5 canvas rendering — no build tools or dependencies required.
